This branding was inspired by my interest in architecture and my desire to create spaces that feel both structured and welcoming. 
I wanted the design to reflect my personality, which is why I combined a clean architectural form with a softer, handwritten logo to 
make it feel more personal. I chose the color palette carefully, using soft pinks and neutral tones to create a calm and creative mood, 
while the green represents growth, balance, and my connection to nature and thoughtful design. One of the most challenging parts was finding
the right balance between elegance and simplicity, especially making sure the logo stayed clear and readable at different sizes. It 
took time to refine the details so everything felt cohesive and intentional. Moving forward, I plan to use this branding across my portfolio,
presentations, and future architectural projects to create a consistent and recognizable identity.
