The profile banner was the easiest to design because it had a simple structure and enough space to clearly showcase the branding without feeling crowded.
I applied consistent branding elements such as the Studio KM logo, the soft pink and green color palette, and the selected fonts to keep everything 
visually connected. To ensure readability, I emphasized the contrast and spacing, making sure the text stood out from the background. I created 
hierarchy by adjusting font sizes and placements so the most important information is noticed first. Keeping the layout clean helped guide the 
viewer’s eye naturally across the design. Through creating these social media graphics, I learned that simplicity is key, especially since people 
usually view content quickly on their screens. This experience showed me how thoughtful design choices can make visuals both attractive and easy to understand.
