1. What design principle did you find most useful?
 The design principle I found most useful was contrast because it made important information stand out and helped guide the viewer’s eye to key points. 
 I also applied that using contrast in colors, font sizes, and shapes can create a more dynamic and visually appealing design. 
 Together with contrast, alignment was helpful in keeping the layout organized and balanced. These principles made my design easier to read and more
 professional-looking. Overall, I realized that applying these principles intentionally can greatly improve how effectively a message is communicated.


2. What part of Canva was easiest/hardest to use?
 The easiest part of Canva to use was the pre-made templates and elements, which gave me a guide on how the overall design would look.
 It made designing less overwhelming and provided inspiration for layouts and color schemes. The hardest part was customizing elements, like arranging 
 text and images so they didn’t overlap or look cluttered. It took time to make sure everything was balanced and visually appealing while still being unique. 
 I also found that choosing the right colors and fonts required careful thought to maintain readability.


3. What did you learn about visual communication?
 I learned that visual communication is about clarity and focus, not just making something look attractive. A well-designed visual guides 
 the viewer’s attention and highlights the main message effectively. Even small details, like spacing, alignment, and color combinations,
 can greatly affect how the audience interprets the message. I also realized that simplicity often works best because too many elements 
 can distract the viewer. I learned that good visual communication requires both creativity and careful planning to make the message clear and engaging.
